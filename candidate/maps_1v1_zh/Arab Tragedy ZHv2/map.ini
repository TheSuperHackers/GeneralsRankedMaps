TransparentWaterMinOpacity = 1.0 ;opacity of water at maximum depth - 1.0 is opaque, 0 transparent.
TransparentWaterDepth = 5.0 ;depth below water surface at which it becomes opaque (unless clipped by TransparentWaterMinOpacity)
StandingWaterColor = R:66 G:211 B:165 ;material color used to tint the water surface.
StandingWaterTexture = TWWater01.tga ; main texture used for water (usually something blue that looks like water).
